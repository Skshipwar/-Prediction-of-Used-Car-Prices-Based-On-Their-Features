Regression Model to predict the price of used-cars

Imported the data of 7800+ units of used cars to Jupyter notebook and cleaned the data in python environment using Pandas and Numpy. The data was then preprocessed to determine the missing values and discrepancies in the data. 

Imputed the missing values using mean of the individual range and identified the factors affecting overall pricing of used cars by testing the data set in different environments. This helped in understanding the individual impact of each factor.

Created a linear regression model to understand the linear relationships and behavior between two variables. Then the data was fit into this model and used decision trees and random forest regressor to predict the price of used cars.
